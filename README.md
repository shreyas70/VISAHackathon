# VISA Experience app
## Hackathon submission by team '6 Rooks'

The VISA experience is a value-added-service for Visa card holders. This app provides a convenient and seemless way to:
1. Make reservations for a variety of services (restaurant booking, movie tickets, golf courses and much more)
2. Avail offers
3. Book cab to and from the service location
4. Pay service provider, in a contact less manner

It is aimed at offering an end-to-end solution for the user. This hackathon demo only takes care of the usecase of making reservations at restaurants.
