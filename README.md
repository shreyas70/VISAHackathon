## VISA Global Intern Hackathon 2020 - Objective
Build a solution that leverages Visa assets (APIs) along with third party capabilities to help consumers/cardholders, businesses, and governments to adjust to disruptions/changes caused by COVID-19 and beyond. 

## VISA Experience - Hackathon submission by team '6 Rooks'

The solution presented won the "Best use of API" award. The hackathon was held among 54 teams, competing from top universities across the globe.

The solution enables users to make reservations at nearby service providers  facilitates contactless payment. Helps merchants impose social distancing by accepting limited number of reservations and helps users avoid crowded places by displaying  wait time. 

Cab booking has been made seamless by integrating with Uber Deeplink. VMROC platform has been used to display offers provided by Visa or the service provider.

It is aimed at offering an end-to-end solution for the user. This hackathon demo only takes care of the usecase of making reservations at restaurants.
